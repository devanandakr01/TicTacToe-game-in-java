# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Java

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-tac-toe game in Java. It allows two players to play against each other on a 3x3 grid, aiming to get three of their symbols ('X' or 'O') in a row, column, or diagonal.

## Features

- Two-player gameplay
- 3x3 grid representation of the game board
- Alternating turns between Player X and Player O
- Validation of player moves to ensure they are within bounds and on empty spaces
- Detection of winning conditions (three in a row, column, or diagonal) or a draw
- Option to play again after the game ends

## How to Play

1. Compile the Java program.
2. Run the compiled program.
3. The game will prompt each player to input their moves alternately.
4. Enter the row and column where you want to place your symbol ('X' or 'O').
5. Ensure that your moves are valid and follow the rules of the game.
6. The game will continue until one player wins or the board is full (resulting in a draw).
7. After the game ends, you may have the option to play again.
